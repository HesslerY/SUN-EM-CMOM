The library attempted to open the following supporting CUDA libraries,
but each of them failed.  CUDA-aware support is disabled.
libcuda.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
libcuda.dylib: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
/usr/lib64/libcuda.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
/usr/lib64/libcuda.dylib: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
If you are not interested in CUDA-aware support, then run with
--mca mpi_cuda_support 0 to suppress this message.  If you are interested
in CUDA-aware support, then try setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the location
of libcuda.so.1 to get passed this issue.
